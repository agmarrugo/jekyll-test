In the latest [Generational podcast][1] episode [Aaron Hillegass][3] told [Gabe](http://www.macdrifter.com/ "Macdrifter") that he wrote his [Objective-C][2] book with his ten-year-old in mind. 

I found this to be quite interesting and truly inspiring. By writing the book "for his son," he made sure anyone could actually read and understand it, but also he was deeply motivated to get it right. I wouldn't want my son to read a crappy book. 

If I ever had to write a guide about how to be (stay) motivated on a project this would definitely be there.
