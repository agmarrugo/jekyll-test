I like to write, for writing reminds me of who I am, who I want to be, and where I come from. It is no mistery that I enjoy it, but that doesn't make it any easier. 

I often get compliments on my writing, but still, I think there's a long way to go before I feel more comfortable with it – I still struggle over single words or sentences. 

Lately, I've been rediscovering myself in many different ways. I find myself more aware of everything – and that is probably not the most interesting thing – if not by chance, by fate, but I do feel different. I certainly am not the same person I was a while ago. I write more, which means *I exit my body more often*.

I write about my writing, for it serves as confession and a means to *see* my reflection in a mirror of prose. A reflection of what I think, and of who I am. It is no coincidence that by writing I often find answers to my problems or get a glance of the next step I should take. 

Writing is *almost* certainly  not for everyone, at least in the sense of writing for the fun of it. I hardly know people – in person that is[^fn1] – that write out of pure pleasure, let alone people that *truly* make a living out of writing. 

[^fn1]: In the *virtual* world, I *do* know a number of people that write for the fun of it and are lucky enough to make a living from it. 

Writing is an art, but is also a skill. A skill that – despite natural talent – requires time and effort in developing. Like [Colin Nissan][2] says in the ["Ultimate guide to writing better than you normally do"][1]

> Writing is a muscle. Smaller than a hamstring and slightly bigger than a bicep, and it needs to be exercised to get stronger. Think of your words as reps, your paragraphs as sets, your pages as daily workouts. Think of your laptop as a machine like the one at the gym where you open and close your inner thighs in front of everyone, exposing both your insecurities and your genitals. Because that is what writing is all about.

Yes, it's about exposing yourself and becoming stronger in the process.
