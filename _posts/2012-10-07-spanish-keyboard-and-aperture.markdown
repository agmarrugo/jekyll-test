My new keyboard.</div>
It's been quite a while since I've grown accustomed to switching back and forth between an english keyboard at home and a spanish keyboard at work. Like anything, at first it takes a while to get fully accustomed, but all in all it isn't too bad. This week my English keyboard at home died, so I bought a new one this time in Spanish, because that was what they had at the store. 

One of the things I don't like of the spanish keyboard [^fn1] is that most (if not all) applications design the shortcuts assuming an English keyboard. Therefore, what could be single key shortcut in the English keyboard becomes a double key shortcut in the  Spanish keyboard. And that's not all. 

<!--more--> 

It just so happens that in some applications, in my case Apple Aperture there are some really nice single key shortcuts like left square bracket (``[``) for rotating an image counterclockwise, but in the spanish keyboard the bracket, while being in the same place has to be typed with the option (``⌥``) key. 

For some unknown reason Aperture doesn't recognize this double key shortcut as the single key shortcut I'm trying to reproduce. As a matter of fact it assumes I'm pressing (``⌥ ` ``), where the back-tick is the other character sharing the same key as the left square bracket.[^fn2]

Square bracket on spanish keyboard.</div>

I have googled a bit about this topic and in an [apple discussion][apple] this was somewhat discussed, but to no great length. And the only solution for the time being is to go to ``'Aperture' > 'Commands' > 'Customize...'``. But I'm still not comfortable changing the default commands in Aperture. I really liked the single key shortcuts for rotating an image and stuff like that. Let's see how this ends up.

[^fn1]: Or any other keyboard that's not the English one.

[^fn2]: The reason I hadn't noticed this is that I don't use Aperture at work.
