The ["Links of Interest"](http://andresmarrugo.net/blog/categories/bookmarks/) is a type of post I'll start to do on a regular basis here. Every now and then I come across something interesting in the web that I'd like to share with my readers, but that doesn't necessarily merit a blog post or I really don't have the time to write one. This type of blog post is inspired by [Brett Terpstra's "Web Excursions"][1] system. As he explains, he prefers a single post with multiple links rather than a ton of individual "link list" posts. I do too.

To find out more about the details and the ruby script for automatically generating the post [go to his website][1]. The links posted here, I've gathered in the past couple of weeks using [pinboard](http://pinboard.in/) an incredibly useful bookmarking service. Enjoy.
