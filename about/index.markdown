My name is Andrés Marrugo, and I’m a professor of Mechatronics Engineering at the Tecnhological University of Bolívar in Cartagena, Colombia. My research interests are: digital image processing, medical imaging and computer vision.

These days I spend most of my time either at work with teaching, research, and [meetings and stuff][meetings] or at home with my wife and my two sons. Becoming a father has been an amazing experience, it has changed my life and the way I look upon life itself. When I'm not being the *family guy* or the *professor*, I'm usually fiddling around at the terminal (doing nerdy stuff), editing photos/videos of my kids, cooking (I love to cook), writing on my journal, catching up on my favorite blogs and podcasts, and--of course--blogging[^foo].

Since 2010 I've been blogging on [Between the Candle and the Star][wordpress] a blog hosted on [wordpress.com][wordpress 2]. It's been quite nice, even more in the last year because I've gotten into the habit of posting more frequently. However, I did feel it was time for a change to something more personal and customizable. That's one of the reasons why I changed to an [Octopress][octopress] powered site. 
<!-- In some future post I'll go into further detail about this. -->

## About this site ##

This site is made of pure HTML, built and published with [Octopress][octopress]. Every post is written in [Markdown][daringfireball]. My host is [Github][github] and the repository is public, so feel free [to check it out][github 2] if you want to see the source. 

An interesting thing about this site is that it is basically two [Octopress][octopress] blogs in one domain. I did this because I wanted a multilingual site, without having to mix the content. So the site you're reading is [andresmarrugo.net][andresmarrugo] the English one, and the other in spanish is [andresmarrugo.net/es][andresmarrugo 2].

I've customized the appearance of the site a bit. A great part is based on the [DarkStripes][melandri] theme by [Alessandro Melandri][melandri 2]. The background is [3px tile][subtlepatterns] from the wonderful [Subtle Patterns][subtlepatterns 2] site.
